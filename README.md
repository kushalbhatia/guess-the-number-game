My first Python Project - Guess the Number Game

Rules:

1. A user must input their name
2. The computer is thinking of a number between 1 and 20
3. The user must enter an integer between 1 and 20
4. The user has a maximum of 6 attempts to correctly guess the number
5. If the user guesses the correct number within 6 attempts, they win
6. If the user does not guess the correct number within 6 attempts, they lose
